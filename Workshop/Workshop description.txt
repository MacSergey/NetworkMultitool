Also, you should provide the game log, comments about errors without game log will be ignored too. Read [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463645931]here[/url] how to share log. 

Although, the best way to solve problems is joining to my discord and write to [b]#Support[/b] channel, unfortunately, steam comments is very useless for conversation.
